## A. Non-normative Ontology Definition

_This section is non-normative._

A non-normative turtle definition of the Activity Streams 2.0 vocabulary is provided [here](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams-owl) and/or at [the namespace](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams) as a convenience for implementers wishing to use RDF mechanisms for processing Activity Streams 2.0. Note, however, that this document provides the normative definition of the Activity Streams 2.0 vocabulary.
